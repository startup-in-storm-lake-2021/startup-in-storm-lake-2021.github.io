<h3>Day # 8 (Monday, May 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
Today for breakfast we went to the local Storm Lake Bakery and got donuts. After work time, we had discussions on additions to the Bit Pit such as couches, bean bags, and possible talk of a hot tub ðŸ˜‰.

The boys went out to ride scooters while the girls stayed in and did window art. This was the creation of Jeffery the dinosaur who was later vandalized  by back-end members. Dinner was at the infamous La Juanita's, and after the team travelled to near-by Alta for some bowling. We were all under the impression that it was a casual competition until we realized Jimmy had a secret skill, blowing everyone out of the water with a score of 195. Our time was cut short by an equipment malfunction of the pin setter. All was well however, we came back to the house and watched the movie "Us" before we went to bed.

<ul>
<li> Front-end - Jamie created a title image for the login and create profile screens, and we added the colored icons to the in game screen. We also added a modal to use for testing. The modal contains an IP and port to connect the back-end and front-end. Jimmy also completed some authentication work.</li>
<li> Back-end - Much of my work on Monday involved debugging the rasterization and storage of paint bombs. Our math was not quite right, and entire rows and columns were missing from our bomb circles.  The other back-end bros added unique constraints to players' usernames within the database, as well as a few crucial routes for creating users provided by the front-end.</li>

<h3>Day # 9 (Tuesday, May 18<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
Today we decided to go out again for breakfast. The team headed to Buffalo Ridge CafÃ© in nearby Alta for some good breakfast. After work time, most everyone took a nap while Jacob prepared homemade sushi for dinner. This was Daymion and Dr. Backman's first time having sushi.

After dinner we played bags/cornhole just outside.  Then, after throwing the frisbee a bit, we went back inside and played a game called Donner Dinner Party. The stakes were high as we needed to get enough food to make it through the night. There was a lot of lying going around so we couldn't trust anyone. Will the pioneers or cannibals win?

<ul>
<li> Front-end - today we worked on some larger tasks such as planning out all of our screens and the navigations between screens and modals. Also completed more authentication work.</li>
<li> Back-end - We found the issue that plagued me Monday. We ended up with some actual honest to goodness functioning rasterization. Jacob and I high-fived.  In the meantime, Jason finished up reporting correct error messages to the front end, so they would be able to tell users what exactly prevented them from creating a user.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Day # 10 (Wednesday, May 19<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>

--- Start Dr. Backman Interlude ---

The team had a very productive morning working through issues and adding features (see front/back-end reports below). The morning work session seemed to breeze by, perhaps because the entire team was eagerly anticipating the arrival of Jamie's mother with her dog, Sadie, in tow. Sadie was, of course, adorable and Jamie showed of her tricks. A big winner was when Jamie pointer a finger gun at Sadie, said Bang, and Sadie played dead. It was awesome. Soon after we headed to BVU to find lunch at a visiting food truck. However, the rain and slow moving line worked against us so we re-routed to have lunch at Smokin' Hereford.

A short while later, we started a trip to Sioux City where we faced our very first escape room as a group. The manager of the escape room showed up a bit late so we spent a while challenging each other to see how high we could jump (yes, really). The escape room was set in the wild west and required us to break out of a jail cell. We actually started the process hand cuffed but the cuffs didn't last long. Also, Jason opened the room-winning door in something around 2 minutes flat! A room record! But, the staff quickly barged in and told us that something went wrong and that the door should only have opened <i>after</i> completing all of the challenges... Well, without giving away any of the secrets of the room, we solved the challenges and successfully escaped. The escape room manager was very embarrassed about her tardiness and the 2-minute win incident at the beginning and so she reimbursed our fee (which we then used to sign-up for another escape room with the same business on a later date -- see Day 18).

After the escape, we decided to eat dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings. While waiting for a table to open up, we made a quick visit to Best Buy across the road to purchase a small sound system with microphone. Much of our work and play has outdoor potential and we found this helped to set our mood and keep us entertained. Of course, Daymion tested it out while sitting in the back of my van while in the parking lot as we waited for our table at BWW. That was... an experience... that we will never forget. It also started of my introduction into the world of meme-creation!

Many wings later, we started the drive back to Storm Lake. Most regrettably, I (Dr. Backman) missed the turn onto Highway 20 which sent us unavoidably into the heart of the ice cream capital of the world, Le Mars, which is home to the Blue Bunny headquarters. Suffering this incredible and demoralizing embarrassment, the students helped me drown my sorrows in ice cream.

--- End Dr. Backman Interlude ---

<ul>
<li>Front-end - Jamie designed the icon to navigate to the view profile page. Jimmy and Deniece worked on incorporating back-end errors to front-end notifications(ex: username or email already taken).</li>
<li> Back-end - Dr. Backman and I spent Wednesday discussing our procedure for getting the correct longitude and latitude pairings for locating our paint bombs sparsely. Basically, we decided to grab the floor and ceiling of our data-points, as these two functions would effectively do the math for us.  Today was known as Daymion and Dr. B's Local Grid Adventure The back-end also switched to a slightly different authentication library than we had originally planned to. The one that was chosen prior, was a little bit dilapidated and unsupported as of late, and it wasn't working how we needed it too. We also created some routes for communicating team ids and colors to front end.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Day # 11 (Thursday, May 20<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
Today after work we had another afternoon at Dr. Backman's house. Before dinner, we did some outside activities such as frisbee, bags(or cornhole. We had a discussion about this that went nowhere), bocce ball, and pool. Dinner was spaghetti bake made by Jamie's mom when she came up the day before. After dinner, we started an unsuspecting movie marathon of Austin Powers, watching the first two movies in one sitting. We finished the night with a few games at the house before bed.

<ul>
<li>Front-end - Today we added emails to profiles, and then created a create profile route to finalize that screen. We also debugged the new_bombs route which is the route that sends all of the bombs from back-end to front-end. Another small fix was to prevent a screen size change from an android keyboard popping up. Jamie and Dr. Backman spent an annoying amount of time trying to solve this.</li>
<li> Back-end - We ended up finishing, fully testing, and integrating user creation with front end on Thursday. We finished our work on creating authorization tokens, and even created dummy data for paint bombs within our test databases.</li>
</ul>
          

<h3>Day # 12 (Friday, May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2021)</h3>
Today we worked later than usual and we had plans to go golfing with Dr. Stone, so we decided to go over to Grand Central to grab a quick lunch. It was perfect timing because soon after we were done eating Dr. Stone was pulling up to the house. The first thing we had to do was give Dr. Stone a tour of our house and workplace. After the tour we headed out to the BVU Lake Creek Golf Course. We decided to start at the driving range because none of us have golfed in a very long time.

{% include carousel.html name="5_21-driving" files="week_2/5_21-Golf-Driving_practice.jpg;week_2/5_21-Golf-Driving_practice_lineup.jpg" captions="Getting setup and ready for the driving range;The practice was well-needed as it had been a while for must of us" %}


After we got warmed up we started our game and the teams were Jamie, Jimmy, and Deniece vs. Jacob and Jason vs. Daymion and Dr. Stone. We jumped into our golf carts and drove over to play the front 9.

{% include carousel.html name="5_21-carts" files="week_2/5_21-Golf-Carts.jpg/week_2/5_21-Golf-Cart-Daymion_Stone.jpg;week_2/5_21-Golf-Cart-Jason_Jacob.jpg;week_2/5_21-Golf-Cart-Jimmy_Jamie.jpg;week_2/5_21-Golf-Cart-Backman_Deniece.jpg;week_2/5_21-Golf-Cart-Down_the_line.jpg;week_2/5_21-Golf-Clubs.jpg" captions="Hopped in and ready to go;Daymion and Dr. Stone played as an alternating pair;Jason and Jacob were a pair;Jimmy and Jamie as well, also with Deniece;Deniece drove and golfed with Jimmy and Jamie while Dr. Backman annoyed everyone by constantly taking pictures;All in a line, ready to play;Clubs about to be well used" %}


So we don't bore you too much there were a few great shots worth mentioning. The first shot was by Jamie. She was hitting the ball from the rough in full force hoping to not hit a tree. Her aim may have been a little off because as she hit the ball she missed her destination and almost took out an innocent squirrel. After her shot she decided to traumatize the squirrel a little more and chase the little guy up the tree. The next shot was from Deniece. As Deniece went to hit the ball, instead of hitting the ball straight she hit it directly sideways straight at Dr. Backman. Luckily, Dr. Backman got a picture of Deniece after this incredible shot.

At the end of our game Jacob and Jason won, but not by much. After we got all done golfing we decided to make a Walmart run so Jamie could make her biscuits and gravy for dinner. According to Daymion they were down-right Jamie-like. Once we got done eating it was time for us to get back to work because we knew we had to have a working demo ready before the weekend. The stakes were high as we needed to have a functioning app to show. Daymion tried infiltrating the front-end couch to sabotage. That effort was quickly deterred as the front-end team defended their territory. As the night went on, talking turned into friendly yelling as insults were thrown around like mad. All turned out well, as no feelings were hurt.

<ul>
<li>Front-end - Today we worked on small problems with functionality. Deniece's task was to disable the android back button from messing up our own navigation buttons. Jamie and Jimmy worked on retracting.</li>
<li> Back-end - We finished up the back-end work on the prototype. It was a big integration day. We discovered an in issue solved by how the front end sent data and how we were processing it. A simple division by 10 fixed our issue, as long as front end sent a maximum of a 20 meter radius.</li>
</ul>
        

<h3>Day # 13 (Saturday, May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2021)</h3>
We woke up early for our Omaha trip, though most of the morning was spent driving to Top Golf.

<center><img src="/assets/images/week_2/5_22-Ready_to_drive.jpg" /></center>

We bought two hours to play, and did so. I got a root beer. We discovered Dr. Backman could easily quit his professing job and become a world class golfer, either that or he lied about never having golfed before. I doubt it was the latter, as Dr. B is the paragon of morality. After our two hours ended, we decided to wander the mall for an hour until our Escape Room. We bought a frisbee, didnâ€™t get any water bottles for the second time this class, and went container shopping. I found a nice trunk, though I couldnâ€™t fit in it, so we put it back. The Container Store woman seemed to be amused by our antics. I found a wicker basket that would have been perfect for playing the harmonica in, but it wasnâ€™t sound-proof, so the others vetoed it.

{% include carousel.html name="5_22-1" files="week_2/5_22-TopGolf-Backman.jpg;week_2/5_22-TopGolf-Daymion_Jamie.jpg;week_2/5_22-Lunch.jpg" captions="Dr. Backman's first swing of a non-putter golf club;Daymion telling tales and Jamie managing her suspicion;Lunch afterwards at a nearby mall" %}

The startup claims they didnâ€™t hear that I wanted to stop at the movie store, but I have my doubts, as they heard my snark about us not stopping there. We then left the mall and played frisbee in front of the escape room. Jamie learned how to bounce the frisbee and Jimmy learned that itâ€™s his job to grab the frisbees we throw down the hill. Sorry Jimmy :(. 

The Escape room was fun. There was a captain who was smuggling folk into America. It was also based on the titanic. I counted cards, read some posters on the wall, and just enjoyed the atmosphere. I helped Jamie and Dr. Backman by giving them light as they tried to navigate keys through a maze using a stick. There were dogs barking and I was sad, because dogs probably didnâ€™t get put on life-boats and thatâ€™s sad. Luckily, it was just from the stereo system and there werenâ€™t real dogs drowning. 

We escaped from the escape room, as you do, and went out for sushi. The one time I had sushi, it upset my stomach, so I decided on a delightful dish called the Itchy Seabass. I didnâ€™t realize it was an appetizer though, and was finished eating before anyone else even got their food. The startup enjoyed their meal and played with my chopsticks until Deniece let me try her wasabi. It tasted very briefly of almonds, and then of fire.

{% include carousel.html name="5_22-2" files="week_2/5_22-Escape_Room_winners.jpg;week_2/5_22-Blue_Sushi.jpg;week_2/5_22-Jamie_Basement.jpg" captions="Escape room winners yet again;The celebratory dinner at Blue Sushi;Daymion was excited to share with us that his Big Mac had 3 buns!" %}

Dr. Backman suggested we stop at McDonald's so I wouldnâ€™t go hungry. I agreed, and got a burger that had 3 pieces of bun, which was novel. Our next stop was at Jamieâ€™s House, where we watched Austin Powers Goldmember, but more importantly, played with Jamieâ€™s dog Sadie, who is a delightful little white dog. I love her very much, Iâ€™ve only known her for a few days, but if anything happened to her, I would comfort everyone in this room and then myself.

Ice Skating was the last thing on our agenda. Iâ€™ve never skated before, and fell around a dozen times over the course of the night. However, I went from hugging the wall and being unable to move at all, to doing several laps around the rink.

Apparently it was teen night at the ice rink. We didnâ€™t know it at the time, but in all honesty it should have been clear, considering the sheer density of little punks there were. One made fun of Dr. Backman, so the startup and I were close to throwing hands, but Dr. B wouldnâ€™t point him out in the crowd for us, so we couldnâ€™t. A bunch of cowboys made fun of me when I fell, and of my hair, which is uncool. I hurt my ankle and it made it hard to walk the next few days, but ice skating was worth it. I donâ€™t think Deniece liked ice skating very much and stopped pretty early, which I understand, ice is scary and falling is no fun.

As you can see here, Jacob showed off by removing one of his hands from the wall!;We enjoyed many laps around the rink. Our feet and ankles took a bit of punishment but we had fun." %}

We went to our sketchy hotel and showered and got ready for bed. We played a few rounds of the Trolley Problem by cyanide and happiness which, for the uninitiated, involves one person playing as the conductor of a runaway train and the others playing as competing train tracks. You donâ€™t want your track ran over, so you need to either entice the conductor into running over the other track by sabotaging what they play, or making your track as innocent as possible. It creates all sorts of convoluted scenarios. At one point, Dr. Backman played cards suggesting that Jimmy should run himself over because he wasnâ€™t going to have any friends in the future, I told Jamie literally no one would miss any of her future kids, and Deniece got stuck with sexy, racist vampires that were totally interested in her. After the trolley game the gang started playing poker.

I decided to skip out though and instead opted to lie in bed and listen to Jacob and Jamie rake in the bets, occasionally stealing Jimmyâ€™s chips, and tempting Dr. Backman into accepting stolen chips which, to his credit, he never took, until I fell asleep
      

<h3>Day # 14 (Sunday, May 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2021)</h3>
I woke up around half an hour later than I intended. Jacob and Jason knocked at the door, apparently Jimmy and I are slow to rise and everyone was waiting for us. Jimmy was already and told me to get up. I did, I think everyone was in a rush to get out of the sketchy hotel. I too, was in a rush to get dressed and ready for the day. I brushed my teeth, got dressed, packed nearly everything, forgot to grab my book, and ran out the door in record time.

The first thing on the agenda today was donuts, as should nearly always be the case. We stopped at Krispy Kreme and ordered a lot of warm donuts. We ate them on the drive to mini-golf. While we put-putted, I found two broken clubs, two golf balls, and picked Jamie a flower. She didnâ€™t accept it. Jacob informed me of the fact that these flowers grow in Iowa too, and they taste just like honey. I learned that was said in jest when I took a bite and it tasted of spinach and pesticide. I putted a consistent 6 on every hole. Everyone else did considerably better, but never more consistently.

Careful, steady shots.;Steady gazes, holding our breaths as the balls approached the cups.;And then, complete havoc. Etiquette was thrown aside.;Power struggles ensued. There could be only one victor." %}

After mini golf, Dr. Backman and I braved the hazards of Sketchy Hotel to retrieve my book. I re-entered my room, and much to my horror, didnâ€™t find it! We nearly gave up hope, when some hapless, yet entirely kind hotel staff-woman returned to me my â€˜only-briefly forgotten aboutâ€™ tome of Linux wisdom. We made a swift egress and tried in vain to forgot the horrors of La Quinta, and even more desperately to forget the kind soul that returned my book to me, the woman who was doomed to forever roam the accursed halls, to forever clean rooms filled with the abject filth of those who couldnâ€™t care less for those that come after.

Next was pizza with the BV Alums. We showed off the Paint Bomb demo, and they gave us career advice. Jamie and I spoke to [NAME REDACTED] of the FBI about what his job was like, how grad school went, and whether or not the FBI should make tree climbing a testable requirement to become an agent. I was alone in my resolve. They gave us interview advice and talked about internships.

The Omaha zoo was the last thing on our agenda for today. We were worried about the sun, so Jimmy smothered himself with childrenâ€™s suntan lotion which, despite his best efforts, would not wipe away as it was as previously stated, childrenâ€™s sun tan lotion.

<center><img src="/assets/images/week_2/5_23-Zoo-Jimmy.jpg" /></center>

Immediately after he realized his mistake, it started down-pouring. We hurried towards the desert exhibit to escape the flood. The desert exhibit was very cool, there were many birds, which are the best animals to gawk at. We left the desert exhibit through the nocturnal animals exhibit. We went through a cave, and eventually a swamp. I got in a staring contest with a crocodile after it swam towards me, until I realized there were beavers, which is what we all are, so I had to investigate. By the time we left the swamp, the downpour had only worsened. We opted to run for the underwater exhibits, as we felt it necessary to acquaint ourselves with those that would survive best in our soon-to-be flooded world.

Deniece didnâ€™t want to slip, so she walked in the rain. I couldnâ€™t run because I got my ankle all cut up and bruised skating the night prior, so I slowly limped my way to the exhibits. The others sprinted and waited at the front of the first exhibit for us. We explored the world beneath the shores, saw some nose fish, and touched two starfish. I preferred the second.

After the flooding stopped and we emerged from below the ocean, the group decided to go to the petting zoo and maybe look at the monkeys. My foot hurt to much to walk too much on, so I decided to chill with the penguins ;). Pun intended. Laugh now please. 

{% include carousel_nocap.html name="5_23-Zoo-3" files="week_2/5_23-Zoo-Animal-Birds.jpg;week_2/5_23-Zoo-Animal-Blue_Fishes.jpg;week_2/5_23-Zoo-Animal-Fuzzy.jpg;week_2/5_23-Zoo-Animal-Jelly_Fishes.jpg;week_2/5_23-Zoo-Animal-Penguins.jpg;week_2/5_23-Zoo-Animal-Statue.jpg;week_2/5_23-Zoo-Animal-Snake.jpg" %}

We met up as the zoo closed. At first I couldnâ€™t find the group, but Dr. Backman did his "look to me" call and I quickly found him. He then demonstrated his Raptor Call. I do not recall the rest of the day. I think it involved Arbyâ€™s, a band-aid stop, and board games. Though, as I said, it is pretty blurry. I was tired and had a long day.
