<h4>Dates: May 24<sup>th</sup> - May 28<sup>th</sup></h4>
<h4>Authors: Jason & Jimmy</h4>

We just got back from our fun weekend trip to Omaha. We had a functional prototype at this point and our new goal was to add any extra features we could fit into one more week of work and get the most out of our last week together.

<h3>Day # 15 (Monday, May 24<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
Monday we were still recovering from our fun weekend in Omaha, so things were pretty quite in the morning. We did have a photo shoot with Colin (a BVU student and summer intern with UMC) which Daymion took full advantage of the opportunity of having a personal photographer at the house. During the day we caught up on some necessities like laundry and sleep. By the evening the quietness had vanished and you could hear the  wildest game of monopoly take place at the VRBO. There was stealing from the bank, random donations of money, and just complete chaos everywhere you looked. In the end we don't really know who officially won, but we decided Daymion won for creating the most chaos.

<ul>
<li> Front-end - One of the features we wanted to add was for people to create their own games that they could play with their friends. After breakfast we had a meeting between both ends on what this would look like and how we were going to accomplish it. On the front-end we came up with a design for the new screens for creating, joining, and continuing games. We also made progress in creating UI skeletons for these screens.</li>
<li> Back-end - In order for us to make sure games stayed local we decided to create a "secret code" when a game is created so only people who knew the code could join the game. On top of that we know made it so after a game is created you can join a game with the "secret code" and then join a team.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Day # 16 (Tuesday, May 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
After work we ate some blue cheese burgers made by Jimmy. Daymion passed out before lunch and we ate his burger out of spite. Then we re-watched the first half of “Invincible” because everyone slept through it the day before. Jamie, the one who recommended we watch the show, had the best nap of her life, and missed it again. Meanwhile, Backman was off maniacally planning our murder mystery dinner for the evening. When he came back, he tossed us in his van and led us to Goodwill for us to pick out our costumes. The roles of the game included three female roles and three male roles but our group has two girls and four guys. Jamie and Deniece got first pick and the guys drew from a hat to decide their fates. Lady luck decided Daymion would play as the promiscuous woman of the night, “Bibi Gun”. He did not hold back when it came to his outfit or trying to seduce everyone at the table. It was fun seeing everyone attempt their best western accents and see Jamie finally understand how lying works. We finished out the night by getting Dairy Queen and watching a few more episodes of “Invincible”.

<ul>
<li> Front-end - Another feature we wanted to have was a way for a user to view their profile and have a place where they can possibly change settings. We discussed with the back-end to send us the information we needed and created a screen to view them. We also finished up our screens for joining and continuing games.</li>
<li> Back-end - After making it so players could join games and teams, we of course had to test that we could actually do that. This is when we realized we that we could join a team multiple times! We knew this wouldn’t do, so we put extra security on joining a game, so if you were already in the game, you couldn’t rejoin it even if you knew the “secret code”</li>
</ul>


<h3>Day # 17 (Wednesday, May 26<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
In the morning we decided to all group up and make some decisions on what we all wanted to get accomplished before the end of the week. This is when we made our end goals for our app and for what other activities we wanted to try and pull off during our last week. After we got done working on Wednesday Dr. Backman shared some great news! The Mini golf course in Storm Lake was finally open so we finally got to test that course out. When we were mini golfing there were many great shots, but there were two hole in ones. The first one was by Jamie and the second one followed not too long after by Jason. After mini golf we came back to the house and just started sitting around talking. As we were talking we decided to try and throw cards to each other and this brought us to the great idea of trying to break a piece of paper by throwing cards at it. Through Jimmy's sacrifice of holding the paper and getting hit when we missed we finally broke the paper after countless attempts. We didn't really feel like going out tonight so instead we just order pizza hut and decided to play Secret Hitler again. After several games Jamie keeps her record of never losing as Hitler and having the record of 4 for 4. To finish off the night we decided to lower the pressure of the games and play some Telestrations, where we learned that Jimmy doesn't know what a horse looks like.

<ul>
<li>Front-end - Wednesday was a busy day. There was a lot of bug fixing and refactoring from the previous day’s work. We also added a screen for creating a game. This allowed users to select the number of teams, players per team, team names, and game name. We still needed to link up with the back-end to actually create the games, but most of the groundwork was now complete.</li>
<li> Back-end - The next thing we thought we needed to account for was how big people actually wanted their games to be. To do this we gave the creator of the game the responsibility to select how many teams they wanted in their game and how many players they wanted in each of the team. We also made it so if a player wanted to continue one of their games they get to see all the games they are currently in and then choose which ever game they want to join.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Day # 18 (Thursday, May 27<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
Operation dinosaur compromised. Daymion knows too much and must be dealt with. If this information spreads, humanity could be at risk. After work we took a trip back to Sioux City to have some fun. First, we stopped by an antique store call “De Wolfe’s” by Daymion’s recommendation. There were a lot of cool retro video games, board games, music, and posters. After that, we went to the mall to wander around. We picked up some board games, got some free chicken nuggets, threw bags in the air really high, and almost got Daymion to pierce his ears. After, the mall, it was time to go to the escape room. This time, the theme was mad scientist. This was the hardest room yet, there were a lot more puzzles and Jacob had to move objects in a box with a camera, but sucked at it. We still got out and proved we are not completely dumb. After we got out, we went to a Japanese Steak house where our eyebrows were burnt off, had food thrown at us, and got to see a cool volcano. Our chef threw about 5 eggs at Daymion even though he showed no effort or interest in catching them. The last thing we did in Sioux City was watch a “Quiet Place 2”. Jamie got scared a few times and was not good at hiding it. When we got back, from our trip, we played Joking Hazard and continued practicing the Rubik's cube.
      
<ul>
<li>Front-end - We linked up our front-end components for creating, joining, and continuing games with the back-end so that we can create games, receive a game code, and share it with other so that they can join. You could then continue any games you currently have going.</li>
<li>Back-end - Now that we have all our features written all that is left to do is test and protect our information. In order to do this, we went back through our code and strengthen its integrity so hackers would have a harder time messing up our game. Another thing we worked on was how fast the players would be able to place their bombs. We decided they would have a full paint meter in an hour so the player didn’t have to always be on the app to launch the bombs.</li>
</ul>
          

<h3>Day # 19 (Friday, May 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021)</h3>
Sadly we are on our last day of the start-up in Storm Lake and tomorrow we need to be all packed up and ready to go our separate ways, but that didn't stop us from enjoying our last day together. We went out to the park across from the house and put the brand new croquet set we bought and within the first game Dr. Backman broke a mallet. After we got done playing croquet we thought it would be best to start hauling things back to Buena Vista University and cleaning up the house, so we wouldn't have to do it right before we left. For our last meal together we decided to go to Zimmy's and that is when we learned that Jimmy doesn't know how big a 14 oz rib eye steak really is. After dinner Dr. Backman taught us a card game he created which Jamie named as Ask Don't Reveal. Jamie ended up destroying Jimmy using her logic in Ask Don't Reveal. To Round out our final night we decided to watch the movie Escape Room. After seeing the movie half of us think that we could easily escape that escape room, but the other half think we are crazy.

<ul>
<li>Front-end - We linked up our front-end components for creating, joining, and continuing games with the back-end so that we can create games, receive a game code, and share it with other so that they can join. You could then continue any games you currently have going.</li>
<li> Back-end - On our final day of work, we combined all of our separate work into one program and did some final testing. After a lot of time of fixing errors, we finally have an app that could be playable by users.</li>
</ul>
