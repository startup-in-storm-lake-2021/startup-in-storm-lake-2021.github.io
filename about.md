Startup in Storm Lake is a May term course facilitated by the [Computer Science 
Department](https://www.bvu.edu/programs/undergraduate/stem/computer-science) 
of [Buena Vista University](https://www.bvu.edu). This awesome experience was 
funded by the School of Science [Stine 
Endowment](https://www.bvu.edu/news/bvu-announces-27-million-endowment-science) 
which provided the financial resources to make this high-impact learning 
experience a possibility for our team.
